# eemR 0.1.2

- Sample names are now exported when using the `eem_export_matlab()` function.

- New function `eem_bind()` implemented to merge objects of class `eem` and `eemlist`.

- Reading EEMs should be ~ 50% faster.

- New function `eem_sample_names()` implemented.
    - `eem_sample_names(eem)` returns a vector containing the sample names of all EEMs.
    - `eem_sample_names(eem) <- c(...)` sets the sample names of all EEMs.

- `eem_extract()` has now an argument `ignore_case` (#10) to specify if the regular expression search should ignore sample name case (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

- Sample names (i.e. file names) are now verified with `make.names()` (#15).

- Various improvements in documentation.
