                   within aquatic ecosystems. The focus of this chapter
                   is to examine studies in both marine and freshwater
                   ecosystems that attempt to link specific members of
                   the bacterial community with specific aspects of DOM
                   processing. To address the seemingly inherent
                   unculturability of bacteria from natural
                   environments, researchers turned to molecular
                   biological techniques to identify bacteria. There are
                   several different methods based on 16S rRNA sequences
                   that can be used to study bacterial community
                   structure. Functional processes are essentially the
                   same in both freshwater and marine systems, the
                   differences become apparent when the emphasis is
                   placed on the source of the Organic Matter (OM). The
                   source of this OM affects the rate at which it is
                   used, not the overall process of use. The
                   availability of organic and inorganic resources and
                   removal of cells by grazing or viral loss are major
                   mechanisms involved in bacterial production and
                   mortality, and thus it is conceivable that these may
                   also regulate microbial population dynamics and
                   diversity.},

  abstract =      {Organic carbon (C) in lakes originates from two
                   distinct sources-primary production from within the
                   lake itself (autochthonous supply) and importation of
                   organic matter from the terrestrial watershed
                   (allochthonous supply). By manipulating the C-13 of
                   dissolved inorganic C, thereby labeling within-lake
                   primary production, we examined the relative
                   importance of autochthonous and allochthonous C in
                   supporting bacterial production. For 35 days,
                   (NaHCO3)-C-13 was added daily to two small, forested
                   lakes. One of the lakes (Peter) was fertilized so
                   that primary production exceeded total respiration in
                   the epilimnion. The other lake (Tuesday), in
                   contrast, was low in productivity and had high levels
                   of colored dissolved organic C (DOC). To obtain
                   bacterial C isotopes, bacteria were regrown in situ
                   in particle-free lake water in dialysis tubes. The
                   contribution of allochthonous C to bacterial biomass
                   was calculated by applying a two-member mixing model.
                   In the absence of a direct measurement, the isotopic
                   signature of the autochthonous end-member was
                   estimated indirectly by three different approaches.
                   Although there was excess primary production in Peter
                   Lake, bacterial biomass consisted of 43-46{\%}
                   allochthonous C. In Tuesday Lake more than 75{\%} of
                   bacterial growth was supported by allochthonous C.
                   Although bacteria used autochthonous C preferentially
                   over allochthonous C, DOC from the watershed
                   contributed significantly to bacterial production. In
                   combination with results from similar experiments in
                   different lakes, our findings suggest that the
                   contribution of allochthonous C to bacterial
                   production can be predicted from ratios of
                   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a surrogate
                   for allochthonous supply) and chlorophyll a (a
                   surrogate for autochthonous supply).},

                   the Earth's surface area, inland freshwater
                   ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and
                   reservoirs) have rarely been considered as
                   potentially important quantitative components of the
                   carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By
                   taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment
                   accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of
                   aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the
                   role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon
                   cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that
                   inland waters annually receive, from a combination of
                   background and anthropogenically altered sources, on
                   the order of 1.9 Pg C y(-1) from the terrestrial
                   landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic
                   sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is
                   returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the
                   remaining 0.9 Pg y(-1) is delivered to the oceans,
                   roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon.
                   Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic
                   systems from land as is exported from land to the
                   sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic
                   systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much
                   of the surrounding land. Although their area is
                   small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect
                   regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of
                   inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight
                   about the storage, oxidation and transport of
                   terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the
                   modern net C sink on land is described.},

                   {\textgreater}70{\%} of the masses detected occurred

                   bioavailable during a 12-d microbial decomposition

                   wide variety of freshwater, coastal and marine

                   were observed, including humic-like, tyrosine-like,
                   and tryptophan-like. Humic-like fluorescence
                   consisted of two peaks, one stimulated by UV
                   excitation (peak A) and one by visible excitation

                   longer excitation wavelength and longer wavelength
                   excitation maximum at longer emission wavelength. A

                   (Ex(max)/Em(max)) for peak C, with maximum at shorter
                   excitation and emission wavelengths for marine
                   samples than for freshwater samples. Mean positions
                   of these maxima were: rivers Ex(max)/Em(max) =

                   different from humic material in the other

                   poorly understood mixture of organic polymers that
                   plays an influential role in aquatic ecosystems. In
                   this study we have successfully characterised the
                   fluorescent fraction of DOM in the catchment of a

                   PARAFAC aids the characterisation of fluorescent DOM
                   by decomposing the fluorescence matrices into
                   different independent fluorescent components. The
                   results reveal that at least five different
                   fluorescent DOM fractions present (in significant
                   amounts) in the catchment and that the relative
                   composition is dependent on the source (e.g.
                   agricultural runoff, forest soil, aquatic
                   production). Four different allochthonous fluorescent
                   groups and one autochthonous fluorescent group were

                   fractions of the DOM pool using this relatively cheap
                   and fast technique represents a significant advance

                   method PARAFAC and its use in chemometrics. PARAFAC
                   is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays,
                   but some of the characteristics of the method are
                   quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There
                   is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure
                   spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral
                   data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components
                   successively as this will give a model with poorer
                   fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated.
                   Finally scaling and centering is not as
                   straightforward in the multi-way case as in the
                   two-way case. An important advantage of using
                   multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is
                   that the estimated models are very simple in a
                   mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and
                   easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are
                   explained in this tutorial and an implementation in
                   Matlab code is available, that contains most of the
                   features explained in the text. Three examples show
                   how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The
                   applications include subjects as: Analysis of

                   PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing,
                   PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC

                   factor rotation do not in general provide strong
                   grounds for attributing explanatory significance to
                   the factors which they select. In contrast, it is
                   shown that an extension of Cattell's principle of
                   rotation to Proportional Profiles (PP) offers a basis
                   for determining explanatory factors for three-way or
                   higher order multi-mode data. Conceptual models are
                   developed for two basic patterns of multi-mode data
                   variation, system- and object-variation, and PP
                   analysis is found to apply in the system-variation
                   case. Although PP was originally formulated as a
                   principle of rotation to be used with classic two-way
                   factor analysis, it is shown to embody a latent
                   three-mode factor model, which is here made explicit
                   and generalized frown two to N "parallel occasions".
                   As originally formulated, PP rotation was restricted
                   to orthogonal factors. The generalized PP model is
                   demonstrated to give unique "correct" solutions with
                   oblique, non-simple structure, and even non-linear
                   factor structures. A series of tests, conducted with
                   synthetic data of known factor composition,
                   demonstrate the capabilities of linear and non-linear
                   versions of the model, provide data on the minimal
                   necessary conditions of uniqueness, and reveal the
                   properties of the analysis procedures when these
                   minimal conditions are not fulfilled. In addition, a
                   mathematical proof is presented for the uniqueness of
                   the solution given certain conditions on the data.
                   Three-mode PP factor analysis is applied to a
                   three-way set of real data consisting of the
                   fundamental and first three formant frequencies of 11
                   persons saying 8 vowels. A unique solution is
                   extracted, consisting of three factors which are
                   highly meaningful and consistent with prior knowledge
                   and theory concerning vowel quality. The
                   relationships between the three-mode PP model and
                   Tucker's multi-modal model, McDonald's non-linear
                   model and Carroll and Chang's multi-dimensional

                   were investigated along a natural gradient of
                   allochthonous influence in the lower Great Lakes.
                   Using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), three DOM
                   fluorophores were identified. One fluorophore,
                   previously identified as peak C, was of allochthonous
                   (component 1) origin and two previously
                   uncharacterized fluorophores were identified as
                   autochthonous (components 2 and 3). Component 1 was
                   photoreactive and the dominant form in creek water
                   samples while components 2 and 3 were dominant in
                   Hamilton Harbour and lake water samples. Components 2
                   and 3 showed limited photoreactivity. Exposure to
                   full spectrum irradiance decreased the average
                   molecular weight of DOM (i.e., increased the
                   absorbance ratio (a254:a365)) for all water samples.
                   DOM bioavailability was lowest in creek and highest
                   in lake water samples and was inversely related to
                   DOM average molecular weight. Photomodification of
                   DOM resulted in higher bacterial activity although
                   these differences were not significantly different.
                   This suggests that light plays a significant role in
                   the cycling of terrestrially-derived DOM and to a
                   certain extent autochthonous DOM, potentially

                   fluorescence describing physical characteristics, for
                   example emission, life-times, and quantum yields. The
                   second chapter offers insights into instrumentation
                   for fluorescence spectroscopy with an introduction to
                   devices such as spectrofluorimeters, lightsources,
                   filters, and detectors. Further on different applica-
                   tions of fluorescence spectroscopy are described
                   explicitly. The measurement methods and the
                   information one can gain from these are explained
                   equally well. The description covers experiments such

                   and energy-transfer experiments, fluo- rescence
                   correlation spectroscopy, and life-time imaging
                   microscopy. For all these topics one can find basic
                   information and useful practical hints. Hence this
                   book covers all topics related to fluorescence

                   moving toward actual topics of research and
                   application. Valuable information is also given in
                   chapters dedicated to fluorophores. In these chapters
                   common natural fluorophores, and novel fluoro- phores
                   such as lanthanides, quantum dots, and metal–ligand
                   complexes are presented and their different

                   clearly arranged overview. At the very end, answers

                   interpolation in the areas affected by first- and
                   second-order Rayleigh and Raman scatter in such a way
                   that the interfering signal is, at best, removed. The
                   suggested method is fast and requires no additional
                   input other than specifying the scattering region.
                   The results of the proposed method were compared with
                   those obtained from common alternative approaches
                   used for preprocessing fluorescence data before
                   analysis with PARAFAC and were shown to be equally
                   good for various types of EEM data. The main
                   advantage of the interpolation method is in its lack
                   of additional metaparameters, its algorithmic speed
                   and subsequent speed-up of PARAFAC modeling. It also
                   allows for using EEM data in software not able to
                   handle missing data. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley

  abstract =      {The fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is
                   suppressed by a phenomenon of self-quenching known as
                   the inner filter effect (IFE). Despite widespread use
                   of fluorescence to characterize DOM in surface
                   waters, the advantages and constraints of IFE
                   correction are poorly defined. We assessed the
                   effectiveness of a commonly used absorbance-based
                   approach (ABA), and a recently proposed controlled
                   dilution approach (CDA) to correct for IFE. Linearity
                   between corrected fluorescence and total absorbance
                   (ATotal; the sum of absorbance at excitation and
                   emission wavelengths) across the full
                   excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in dilution series
                   of four samples indicated both ABA and CDA were
                   effective to an absorbance of at least 1.5 in a 1 cm
                   cell, regardless of wavelength positioning. In
                   regions of the EEMs where signal to background noise
                   (S/N) was low, CDA correction resulted in more
                   variability than ABA correction. From the ABA
                   algorithm, the onset of significant IFE
                   ({\textgreater}5{\%}) occurs when absorbance exceeds
                   0.042. In these cases, IFE correction is required,
                   which was the case for the vast majority (97{\%}) of
                   lakes in a nationwide survey (n= 554). For highly
                   absorbing samples, undesirably large dilution factors
                   would be necessary to reduce absorbance below 0.042.
                   For rare EEMs with ATotal {\textgreater} 1.5 (3.0{\%}
                   of the lakes in the Swedish survey), a 2-fold
                   dilution is recommended followed by ABA or CDA
                   correction. This study shows that for the vast
                   majority of natural DOM samples the most commonly
                   applied ABA algorithm provides adequate correction
                   without prior dilution. {\textcopyright} 2013, by the

  abstract =      {The use of fluorescence spectrometry has been
                   suggested as a simple method to determine the extent
                   of natural organic matter humification by quantifying
                   the red-shifting of fluorescence emission that occurs
                   with increasing humification. Humification indices
                   are calculated by dividing fluorescence intensity at
                   longer wavelengths by intensity at shorter
                   wavelengths. These indices calculated without any
                   specific efforts to standardize dissolved organic
                   matter (DOM) concentration will result in index
                   values that vary with DOM concentration due to
                   fluorescence inner-filtering effects. This study
                   critically evaluated the effect of DOM concentration
                   on humification index determination using organic
                   matter isolated from field corn extract, soil: water
                   extract, and soil fulvic acid. The results show that
                   humification index values are sensitive to DOM
                   concentration of the solution and are linear with
                   respect to transmittance of the solution at the 254
                   nm used as the excitation wavelength. An approximate
                   correction for DOM is to exploit the linear nature of
                   the regression fit and to determine index values at
                   the extrapolated 100{\%} transmittance value. An
                   exact correction using explicit correction factors
                   for both primary and secondary inner-filtration
                   effects was shown to give humification index values
                   that are concentration invariant when absorbance of
                   the solution at 254 nm was less than approximately
                   0.3 unit. Defining the humification index as the
                   fluorescence intensity in the 300--{\textgreater}345
                   nm region divided by the sum of intensity in the
                   300--{\textgreater}345 nm and 435--{\textgreater}480
                   nm regions was statistically advantageous. This study
                   suggests that for quantitative results which can be
                   used to compare humification of natural organic
                   matter across different studies, correction of the
                   fluorescence emission spectra for inner-filtration
                   effects is needed.},

                   productive systems that receive important inputs of
                   dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and
                   in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a
                   significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the
                   DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial

                   heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing

                   algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental
                   variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in
                   aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric
                   eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial
                   connectivity into account. The combination of spatial
                   and environmental models explained 85{\%} of the DOM
                   variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an
                   important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction
                   of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to
                   the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the
                   longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in
                   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by
                   terrestrial input of DOM originating from the
                   tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that
                   freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the
                   preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria
                   undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM
                   was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation
                   coefficient of UVA radiation.},
